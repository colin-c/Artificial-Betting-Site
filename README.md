## Artificial Gambling Site

An artificial gambling site that focuses on player betting along with common
gambling games such as black jack and roulette. Similar to sports betting, one
can add in *players* and place bets on the odds they would win in a particular
event. Then funds would be awards to the wins while the losers lose theirs.

Gambling in real life isn't a very healthy hobby. However,
it is always more fun to play with something at stake, whether that's
gambling on your favourite team or local bets between friends.
Thus, an artificial gambling sites can give the excitement
that gambling provides without the harm of it. I, myself, tend to believe
 myself to be a competitive individual, and believe this gambling site 
would be very helpful to getting a friendly yet competitive environment 
between me and my peers.
